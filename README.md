### This project is split into multiple sections and parts to learn and teach myself about distributed services with Go.
**Section 1**: The basic elements
 - Building a storage layer
 - Defining data structures
 
 **Part 1**: Begin the project by building a simple JSON over HTTP commit log service.\
